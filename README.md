Hello and Welcome to Tiyarjiz Website!

We are 4 UST IT students who are making a website for our fellow classmate/client who owns a customized rugs business.

This project is done to partially fulfill our grades for our Web Development (Front-end) course.

This project will utilize HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in accomplishing our client's rug website entitled "Tiyarjiz".

So sit back, relax, and let us cook!ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥
